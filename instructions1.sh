 To make the ${CG}@tweet2doom ${CC}bot play a certain sequence of keys, reply to them
 with a tweet containing the text ${CG}/play [input]${CC}. The ${CG}[input]${CC} text can be any
 combination of the allowed characters. Use the comma ${CG}, ${CC}character to mark the
 beginning of a new frame. To make the bot hold down a certain set of keys
 for more than one frame use the ${CG}N- ${CC}prefix (note: ${CG}N < 100 ${CC}frames).
